Module.exports (CommonJS used in NodeJS) has not been implemented in the browsers yet.

Bable compiles the es6 js code to es5 code to get the full browser compatibility

Webpack is a bundler which basically bundles all the js/images/static resource into a single bundle or js file

it has loaders which basically converts different file type to static javascript

with just webpack we can use es5 syntax import and export

webpack compiles all the modules and their dependencies into static files that can be run in the browsers.
It uses node modules and compile it back to the js file which can be run into browsers.
